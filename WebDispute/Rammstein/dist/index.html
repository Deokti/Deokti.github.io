                    <p>Rammstein is a German band formed in Berlin in 1994. The band comprises lead vocalist Till Lindemann, <br> lead guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe, rhythm guitarist Paul Landers, bassist Oliver Riedel, drummer Christoph <br> Schneider, and keyboardist Christian "Flake" Lorenz. Prior to their formation, some members were <br>  associated with East German punk rock acts Feeling B and First Arsch.</p>
                    <p>The whole concept of the band was and remains to shock and provoke the music world. And no band has done <br> it quite like Rammstein. Their hard-as-nails beats, heavy guitar riffs and militaristic stage show punctuated by <br> explosions and pyrotechnics are backdropped with ever-more provocative video clips as the recent <br> "Deutschland" single proved.</p>
